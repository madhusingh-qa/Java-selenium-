	// 1. declare methods no body
	//2. can declare variable that is static in nature..we can't change variable value
	//3. we can't write static method and there is no main main methods
	//4. we can create object so its abstract in nature
	//can not create a object of Interface (USBank)
	// if a class is impleming any interface then its mandatory to define all the methods of interface
